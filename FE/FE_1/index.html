      The Pixel XL 2 is also rumored to be water and dust resistant. It is expected to be either IP67 or IP68 rated, meaning it will survive being submerged in 1 to 1.5 meters of water for a period of 30 minutes. As a refresher, the current Pixel generation is only IP53 rated, which basically means it won’t die on you if it’s sprayed with water here and there, but definitely isn’t suitable for anything more than that.
